Building a web app to find trivia questions by category

To complete this challenge, build a web application that:
* has a search function that displays results in an intuitive, responsive, mobile friendly, easy to navigate interface.
* gives users the ability to refine search results by:
  * date or timeframe aired (you can search by a day,  a week, a month)
  * trivia category
  * level of difficulty of the question
  * any other smart searching criteria you see fit

Optional: You may want to include these bonus features:

* Game board simulation with the categories and questions in the proper place (as it would be organized in the game with easier questions on top)
* Marking or saving questions into a "favorites" collection
